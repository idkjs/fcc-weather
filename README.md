# FreeCodeCamp Weather App Code Challenge

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:idkjs/fcc-weather.git
    cd fcc-weather
    npm install

## Development mode

Running `npm run dev` will run the __webpack-dev-server__ on port 3000. You can then develop and webpack will watch for file changes and
rebuild. BrowserSync will refresh the page.

## Build

Running `npm run build` will create a `dist` folder with the `index.html`, `main.js`, `index.css` and `tachyons.css`
files for you to distribute or deploy

## Not Deployed

The app doesnt run deployed because of https issues with the openweathermap api.
You can download the demo directory and open index.html from your local machine to see it run.
